**Blast Off with the **Neotrellis** Sound Synthesizer!** (43728)

> The NeoTrellis-M4 is like a mini-computer with a grid of colorful, light-up buttons that you can press. It's a fun and easy-to-use device for creating light shows, music, or even simple games without needing extensive knowledge of electronics. This three-day course is designed to introduce Scratch and Python. Both learning tools allow children to produce music or short video to better understand computers.

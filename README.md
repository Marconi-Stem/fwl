> The NeoTrellis-M4 is like a mini-computer with a grid of colorful, light-up buttons that you can press. It's a fun and easy-to-use device for creating light shows, music, or even simple games without needing extensive knowledge of electronics. This three-day course is designed to introduce Scratch, Python and micro-controllers. These tools allow children (10-14) to produce music or short videos and better understand computers.
